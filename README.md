# Introduction
This is my attempt at rewriting the Source 2013 SDK's C++ code to C#.

>[!NOTE]
>This project is not endorsed in any way by the original developers of the Source SDK, Valve!
>
>The only reason why I'll keep working on this is by assuming that the source code will remain open source during my work on rewriting it.

### Why?
The reason for me doing this is completely arbitrary. I tried coding using C++, but I soon realized that my C++ game programming skills were non-existent, so I got the idea to give it a similar treatment as my [Quake C# project](https://github.com/OMGOMGplays/QuakeCSharp), and rewrite the whole of the SDK to C#.

And also because I'm bored.

### Progress
![Multiplayer](https://progress-bar.dev/1/?title=Multiplayer)
![Singleplayer](https://progress-bar.dev/1/?title=Singleplayer)

> These progress bars will be counted by our file count divided by the SDK's file count in their respective folders (sp & mp)
